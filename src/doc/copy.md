### Get it Right the First Time

When you’re out in the work, every step matters. Construct helps you walk the site, spot issues, log them instantly, and close them out — no paperwork, no desktop, no BS. It’s quality assurance that fits in your pocket.

* Log issues with GPS-precision from your phone
* Create punchlists that get acted on, not ignored
* Works offline, in the sun, on your terms

### Know the Quality Before the Handoff

You can’t fix what you can’t see. With Construct, you get real-time visibility into field observations, trends, and closeout rates — so you can ensure quality before it hits operations.

* One dashboard for every open issue, inspection, and status
* Share updates with owners and subcontractors automatically
* Analyze trends, not just check boxes

### The Problem with Rework: Safety, Cost, and Time

40% of all site injuries happen during rework. Missed issues don’t just cost money — they put crews at risk and projects behind schedule. First Time Quality isn’t a slogan. It’s a way to build smarter, safer, and faster.

* Every observation tracked and assigned
* Fewer return trips = less risk, more trust
* Start building a culture of accountability

### Field Mode: Offline, but always on

No WiFi? No problem. Construct’s Field Mode lets you work fully offline — log observations, add photos, tag locations — then sync it all back at the trailer.

* Full offline functionality
* Easy upload once connected
* Built for the real-world conditions of utility-scale sites

### Assign, Notify, Close Out: Move fast, stay accountable

No more “who’s fixing this?” Assign issues to the right crew, notify them instantly, and track status from open to verified. It’s punchlist flow — minus the chaos.

* Assign issues to users by role, crew, or company
* In-app and email notifications
* Due dates, priorities, and filters built in

### Inspections Program: From random checks to structured excellence

Whether you're doing a full handoff inspection or spot-checking piles, Construct makes inspections easy to build, manage, and track.

* Inspection templates for every scope
* Location-linked findings and status
* Export-ready reports for walkthroughs

### Digital Twin: See the job, not just the list

Every observation ties to the actual build, mapped and time-stamped. With Construct’s spatial QA, you don’t just get data — you get context.

* Map-based interface with every QC activity pinned
* Historical record of what was done, when, and by who
* Built-in navigation to find the work on site

### Reporting & Exports: From punchlist to PowerBI

Need to report out? Construct makes it easy. Export observations, inspections, and summaries in the formats your teams already use.

* Custom Excel exports for remediation crews
* CSV reports for inspections
* API access coming soon for PowerBI and Procore

### GPS & Site Navigation: Know where you’re needed

You’re not just logging data — you’re moving through a 1,000-acre job site. Construct uses GPS to help you locate issues, scan the work, and get there faster.

* Geotagged observations
* Real-time location on the site map
* AI-powered inspection suggestions based on location (beta)

### Plugged In: Procore, Sharepoint, and more

You don’t need another silo. Construct integrates with the tools you’re already using — so nothing gets lost between systems.

* Procore integration for workflows and documents
* Sharepoint connection for plan sets
* CSV/Excel exports compatible with every major platform

* Aerial inspection via drones
* Robotics-assisted module scan
* AI-powered issue detection + trends
